# CS2315 - Computer Programming

Welcome to my repository for **CS2315 - Computer Programming**, a course offered by the Department of Computer Science at City University. This repository contains my coursework assignments, showcasing my learning journey in object-oriented programming and core programming concepts. The course was taken in [Semester/Year, e.g., Fall 2023], and no prior programming experience was required.

## 📚 About the Course
**CS2315 - Computer Programming** is a 3-credit course designed to equip students with key programming concepts and techniques using a high-level object-oriented programming language. The course aims to develop practical skills in producing quality programs.

- **Course Objectives**:
  - Understand fundamental programming concepts.
  - Apply object-oriented programming principles (e.g., classes, objects, inheritance).
  - Develop problem-solving skills through coding assignments.
- **Assessment**:
  - Continuous Assessment: 40% (Assignments, quizzes, etc.)
  - Final Examination: 60% (2-hour exam, minimum 30% required to pass)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: C++ 
- **Tools**: VS Code

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository contains my assignments from CS2315, each organized in its own folder with its own README for clarity.
